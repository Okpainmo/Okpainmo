I'm Andrew James Okpainmo. I am a highly gifted and super-intelligent Nigerian software engineer, who is passionate about building ground-breaking inventions with code.

I am currently a fullstack Javascript/Typescript developer(ReactJs/NextJs + NodeJs), a blockchain(Solidity) developer, and a technical writer.
I am also currently getting a hand on devOps and cloud computing.

In recent times, I am becoming highly interested in tech entrepreneurship and tech mentorship. I am currently building my first startup - Jobjo, alongside Zoe collectives - mother company to a fleet of sub-startups.

I publish tech content on my ![YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0CKKi10MJUAKWKJ8nZe9Kw)
where I share my expertise through deep tutorials to help developers become better.

I love God a lot, and people do mean a lot to me as well.

Below is a link to my Resume/CV where you can find a lot more about my expertise.

Cheers!!!.
