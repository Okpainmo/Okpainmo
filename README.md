My name is Andrew James Okpainmo. I am a highly gifted and super-intelligent Nigerian software engineer, who is passionate about building ground-breaking inventions with code.

I am currently a full-stack Javascript/Typescript developer(ReactJs/NextJs + NodeJs), a blockchain(Solidity) developer, and a technical writer.
I will also be a very capable hand if you need help with DevOps and/or cloud computing.

With a good eye for design, and thanks to the years Iâ€™ve spent learning and practising front-end development as a profession(About 6 years or more in all), I am passionate about crafting cutting-edge and pixel-perfect project front-ends.
My experience and graceful brilliance, also help me build project back-ends and blockchain solutions that will appeal to both users and clients alike.  


I am an avid learner - *basically, I never stop learning* - especially because software engineering is my passion. I always keep striving to become a better engineer. 
I'm passionate about the happiness of others, and seek to always collaborate effectively and amicably with everyone. I'm passionate about my work
for employers(Fidelity is my watchword).

I've led and continue to lead teams at different positions throughout my career, hopefully, you're here to have me become one on your project soon ðŸ˜Š.

In recent times, I have become highly interested in tech entrepreneurship and tech mentorship. I am currently building my first startup - Jobjo, alongside Zoe collectives - mother company to a fleet of sub-startups.

I publish tech content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0CKKi10MJUAKWKJ8nZe9Kw)
where I share my expertise through impressive tutorials/courses to help developers become better.

I love God a lot, and people do mean a lot to me as well.

Below is a link to my Resume/CV where you can find a lot more about my expertise.

Cheers!!!.
