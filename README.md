<h1>Hi There ðŸ‘‹!, Nice to meet you</h1>

My name is Andrew James Okpainmo, I'm a highly intelligent product-driven Nigerian software engineer with a strong interest in startups. 

With a passion for software engineering and my avid-learning nature, I've been able to build a solid software engineering career with skills in full-stack development, Mobile development(React Native) and multi-chain blockchain development(Solana(Rust) and Ethereum(Solidity)). I'll also perform decently in any DevOps-related role.

Feel free to ask me anything about:

â€¢ Software architecture | Full-stack development | Microservices | Blockchain development | Project management | Technical writing |
Mobile development | Hiring contributions, team building, team management, and culture engineering.

â€¢ **Fullstack development**: ReactJs | NextJs | NodeJs | Rust | Javascript | Typescript | Redux tool-kit | HTML | CSS | SCSS | Bootstrap | TailwindCSS | Zod |
Jquery | Vercel | Netlify | Firebase | Headless UI  | ExpressJs | Mongoose | RabbitMQ | Render | Jest | React Testing Library | Open
Telemetry | Jaeger | Redis | Git/Github | MongoDB | PostgreSQL | Docker | AWS and more.

â€¢ **Blockchain development(Ethereum and Solana)**: Solidity | Rust | Anchor | Hardhat/EthersJs | ChainLink | Open-zeppeling | Aave | IPFS |
Pinata | Ganache | Fleek | Metaplex and more.

â€¢ **Mobile development**: React Native | Expo and more.

With valuable years of experience, and different attempts at building some(startups) for myself and for clients, I've been able to build an impressive track record of leading and coordinating software engineering teams. 

I currently work as a freelance software engineer while building and pursuit my startup aspirations.

One other field that I'm currently passionate about is web3/blockchain. 2024 is the year I'm inclined to settle as a web3-heavy software engineer. To pursue this course, I'm currently building a web3 education(talent development) and talent management startup called [Web3 Mastery](https://web3mastery.org).

I'm currently open to software roles across front-end development, back-end development, full-stack engineering, mobile development and blockchain development.

I'll be glad to join new engineering teams to share my engineering and start-up building experience wherever necessary.

Cheers!
