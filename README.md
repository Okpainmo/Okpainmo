<h1>Hi There ðŸ‘‹!, Nice to meet you</h1>

I am a versatile senior software engineer specializing in full-stack engineering and blockchain development. Feel free to call me â€˜a one-man startup/agency powerhouseâ€™. 

I pride myself in being "A strategic generalist"!!!

I excel in taking ownership, and spear-heading the development(from ground up - including Cloud Engineering and DevOps) of scalable, high-quality software across web, mobile, and blockchain platforms.

I've led multiple on teams, both in engineering and management, and I'm currently Founder/Agency-Lead and CTO at Zed Labs.

I'm currently focused hard on contributing value to the global Web3 ecosystem - architecting and building end-to-end blockchain systems - especially on Ethereum.

- Tools I'm familiar with: Typescript/NodeJs/ReactJs/NextJs/React Native, Solidity(EVM), Rust(plus Solana) and Python/Django, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and a WHOLE lot more.
