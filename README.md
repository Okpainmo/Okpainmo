Greetings.

My name is Andrew James Okpainmo, I'm a highly intelligent, product-driven Nigerian software engineer. 

With a passion for software engineering and my avid-leaning nature, I've been able to build a solid software engineering career with skills in full-stack development, 
Mobile development and blockchain development. I'm currently inclined towards advancing my full-stack career into DevOps engineering as well.

I'm skilled in different core technologies including(but not limited to):

ReactJs/NextJs, Typescript, NodeJs, and ExpressJs - for full-stack development. 
React Native/Expo - for mobile development.
Solidity and Hardhat for blockchain development. 
AWS for cloud administration/management. And
MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL - as databases

I'm very passionate about startups. With different attempts at building some(startups) for myself and for clients, I've been able to build an impressive track record of leading and coordinating software engineering teams. 

I currently work as a freelance software engineer, and part-time Senior(Lead) Software Engineer at Terabyte. 

One other field that I'm currently passionate about is web3/blockchain. 2024 is the year I'm inclined to settle as a web3-heavy software engineer. To pursue this course, I'm currently building a web3 startup - [Web3 Mastery](https://web3mastery.org).

I'm currently open to software roles across front-end development, back-end development, full-stack engineering, mobile development and blockchain development.

I'll be glad to join new engineering teams to share my engineering and start-up building experience wherever necessary.

Cheers!
