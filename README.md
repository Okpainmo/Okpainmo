My name is Andrew James Okpainmo, I'm a highly intelligent and product-driven Nigerian software engineer. 

With a passion for software engineering and my avid-learning nature, I've been able to build a solid software engineering career with skills in full-stack development, Mobile development and blockchain development. I'll also perform decently in a DevOps-related role as well.

I'm very passionate about startups. With some valuable years of experience, and different attempts at building some(startups) for myself and for clients, I've been able to build an impressive track record of leading and coordinating software engineering teams. 

I currently work as a freelance software engineer while building [Web3 Mastery](https://web3mastery.org).

One other field that I'm currently passionate about is web3/blockchain. 2024 is the year I'm inclined to settle as a web3-heavy software engineer. To pursue this course, I'm currently building a web3 education(talent development) and talent management startup called [Web3 Mastery](https://web3mastery.org).

I'm currently open to software roles across front-end development, back-end, full-stack engineering, mobile development and blockchain development.

I'll be glad to join new engineering teams to share my engineering and start-up building experience wherever necessary.

Cheers!
